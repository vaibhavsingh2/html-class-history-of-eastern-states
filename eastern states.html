<h1>3) Meghalaya</h1>

<h2 style="color:red">History</h2>

Meghalaya, alongside neighbouring Indian states, has been of archaeological interest. People have lived in Meghalaya since the Neolithic. Neolithic sites discovered so far are located in areas of high elevation in Khasi Hills, Garo Hills and in neighbouring states, where Neolithic style jhum or shifting cultivation is practised even today. The highland plateaus fed by abundant rains provided safety from floods and a rich soil.[19] The importance of Meghalaya is its possible role in human history via domestication of rice. One of the competing theories for the origin of rice comes from Ian Glover, who states, "India is the center of greatest diversity of domesticated rice with over 20,000 identified species and Northeast India is the most favorable single area of the origin of domesticated rice."[20] The limited archaeology done in the hills of Meghalaya suggest human settlement since ancient times.[21]

<h2 style="color:red">Culture</h2>

<h4>1) The People</h4>

The Khasi, Jaintia, Bhoi, War collectively known as the Hynniewtrep people predominantly inhabit the districts of East Meghalaya, also known to be one of the earliest ethnic group of settlers in the Indian sub-continent, belonging to the Proto Austroloid Monkhmer race.

<h4>2) Dress</h4>

The traditional Khasi male dress is “Jymphong” or a longish sleeveless coat without collar, fastened by thongs in front. Now, the Khasis have adopted the western dress. On ceremonial occasions, they appear in “Jymphong” and dhoti with an ornamental waist-band.

The Khasi traditional female dress is rather elaborate with several pieces of cloth, giving the body a cylindrical shape. On ceremonial occasions, they wear a crown of silver or gold on the head. A spike or peak is fixed to the back of the crown, corresponding to the feathers worn by the menfolk.

<h4>3) Food & Drinks</h4>

The staple food of Khasis is rice. They also take fish and meat. Like the other tribes in the North-East, the Khasis also ferment rice-beer, and make spirit out of rice or millets by distillation. Use of rice-beer is a must for every ceremonial and religious occasion.

<h1>4) Manipur</h1>

<h2 style="color:red">History</h2>

During the latter part of its history, Manipur and its people were known by different names to their neighbours. The Shans or Pongs called the area Cassay, the Burmese Kathe, and the Assamese Meklee. In the first treaty between the British East India Company and Meidingu Chingthangkhomba (Bhagyachandra) signed in 1762, the kingdom was recorded as Meckley. Bhagyachandra and his successors issued coins engraved with the title of Manipureshwar, or lord of Manipur and the name Meckley was discarded. Later on, the Sanskritisation work, Dharani Samhita (1825–34) popularized the legends of the derivation of Manipur's name.[6]

Iromba is a fermented delicacy, which is a combination of fish, vegetables and bamboo shoots.

<h4>2) Music</h4>

Pena Ishei is another form of song which is accompanied with the help of a musical instrument called Pena. The theme is mostly the love story of Khamba-Thoibi. A Pena looks like a slender bamboo rod which is attached to the round dry shell of gourd of coconut. To produce the musical symphony, the bamboo rod is held in the left hand, and the drum shell is pressed against the chest. The right hand is used for holding the curved iron rod.

<h1>5) Mizoram</h1>

<h2 style="color:red">History</h2>

The earliest documented records of Mizoram were from the British military officers in the 1850s, when they encountered a series of raids in their official jurisdiction in Chittagong Hill Tracts from the neighbouring natives. By then they referred the land to as Lushai Hills. As a consequence of relentless tribal encroachment and often resulting in human mortality, British rulers were compelled to subjugate the tribal chiefdoms. Punitive British military expeditions in 1871 and 1889 forced the annexation of the entire Lushai Hills. After the Indian independence from British Empire in 1947, the land became Lushai Hills district under the Government of Assam. In 1972 the district was declared a union territory and was given a more culturally inclusive name Mizoram. Ultimately Mizoram became a full-fledged federal state of India in 1986.

Nagaland has no early written history, although medieval chronicles of the neighbouring Ahom kingdom of Assam tell of the Naga tribes, their economy, and their customs.

Once a prevalent ritual, Head Hunting has now become obsolete. In this ritual, the warring tribes used to take the heads of their enemies in order to establish triumph.

Hinduism, Islam and Jainism forms the Minority Religions of Nagaland along with smaller percentages of Sikhism, Naga Folk Religions and others.

<h4>4) Marriage Culture</h4>

The Nagas follow some atypical traditions when it comes to marriage. Any relationship between a boy and a girl within the same community is considered as a social evil. The Angami tribal members tend to strangle a fowl and decide the fate of the couple on the basis of the posture which the fowl adopts while dying. The match is immediately broken if the fowl adopts an inauspicious posture.

<h4>5) Art and Craft</h4>

Though the main occupation of the Nagaland people is irrigation, they have been blessed with dexterity, especially the women. The ordinary metals such as iron, brass and tin are used to make exquisite jewellery in the form of armlets, neckbands, bangles and much more. Beads are also used to make beautiful necklaces.

<h4>6) Folk Dance and Music of Nagaland</h4>

Owing to the joie de vivre nature of Nagas, dance and music are an essential part of their culture. The tribal dance and music will set your feet tapping. The dance is generally performed in groups on the folk songs perfectly synchronised with music through various musical instruments such as Asem (drums), Tati, Mouth Organ, Bamboo Flute, etc. The tribal dance becomes more extravagant by the virtue of the colourful and unique traditional costumes and jewellery. The folk songs narrate the stories of bravery, romance and historic incidents. Certainly, this place has some fantastic taste in dance and music which tourists tend to cherish. 

<h4>7) Festivals of Nagaland</h4>

There is an essence of celebration in the air throughout the year in Nagaland. The diversity of tribes in the region leads to a yearlong ambience of joy through various fairs and festivities organised from time to time. Some of the most important festivals celebrated by different tribal groups are Suhkruhnye, Yemshe, Sekrenyi, Moatsu Mong, Bushu and many others. The general festivals such as Christmas, New Year, etc are also celebrated in accordance to the tribal festivals.

<h4>8) Nagaland Food</h4>

The soft and sweet spoken Nagaland people do not mind spiciness in their food. The kitchen in every household of Nagaland has some good deal of spices stored. Even the ginger used by the people in this region is different from the regular one. The spiciness and aroma which their ginger comprises are hard to find elsewhere. Nagaland is the home of Bhut Jolokia, one of the spiciest chillies in the world.

<h2 style="color:red">Culture</h2>

<h4>1) Tripuri Traditional Attire</h4>

Tripuris have their own traditional dress, similar in style to that of other North-East Indian peoples. It is, however, different in pattern and design. The clothing for the lower half of the body is called rignai in Tripuri and for the upper half of the body, the clothing has two parts, the risa and rikutu.

Isree(Qeen) Monmohini Devi in Traditional Risa The risa covers the chest area and the rikutu covers the whole of the upper half of the body. Formerly, these garments were woven by women using home-spun cotton thread. Nowadays, the threads are bought from the market and the risa is not worn; instead a blouse is worn by most Tripuri women. Girls wear rignai with tops, too. Each Tripuri clan has its own rignai pattern and design. The patterns of the rignai are so distinct that the clan of a Tripuri woman can be identified by the pattern of her rignai. However, there is intermingling of the rignai: Clans wear the rignai of other clans freely and new designs are being woven. The rikutu is plain cloth of a different colour and shade than the other items of clothing. Today, the rikutu is woven by Tripuri women.

<h4>Handicrafts</h4>

Tripura is noted for bamboo and cane handicrafts.[2] Bamboo played important part in the jhumia (shifting cultivation) of the tribes. It was used to make watch stations on stilts and was devised to carry food and water. Besides these usages, bamboo, woods and cane were used to create an array of furniture, utensils, hand-held fans, replicas, mats, baskets, idols and interior decoration materials.[3][4]
